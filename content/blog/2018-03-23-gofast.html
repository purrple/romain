<p>Today was about adding some more confidence about the feasability of <code>ergo</code>. In particular I was interested about these two problems that I decided to play with at the same time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Returning a slice of go strings to the R side. We’ve already seen how to <a href="https://purrple.cat/blog/2017/06/10/using-go-strings-in-r/">return a single string</a> and how to return a <a href="https://purrple.cat/blog/2017/07/03/go-slices/">slice of numbers</a> but slices of strings are a different beast.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/">ast</a> package to manipulate go code as an abstract syntax tree (ast).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The motivation for the first item should be obvious, so let’s talk about the motivation for the second ⚫. We need some background first. Remember Rcpp attributes, most notoriously these <code>// [[Rcpp::export]]</code> comments you add before a C++ function to express that you want this function available to the R side, something like this:</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code>// [[Rcpp::export]]
double fahrenheit(double celcius){
  return 32 + 1.8 * celcius ;
}</code></pre>
<p>Attributes is one of the best things that ever happened to Rcpp, this was an amazing piece of engineering work by <a href="https://twitter.com/fly_upside_down">JJ</a> that has changed for the better how we use C++ functions with Rcpp. But this was not the original plan. Initially we wanted something automatic, something that would identify automatically functions that could be exported, or perhaps based on some naming convention. The problem is C++ is very hard to parse.</p>
<p><a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> on the other hand is a simpler language, and its standard library comes with all the tools to analyse Go code, transform it into an ast, manipulate it, and so on. There are many resources to understand how this works, e.g. I’ve watched this video:</p>
{{< youtube "oxc8B2fjDvY" >}}
<p>and played with this <a href="https://zupzup.org/go-ast-traversal/">blog post</a>. In short once you have parsed a Go file with <code>parser.ParseFile</code> you can traverse the nodes of the ast with <code>ast.Inspect</code> function.</p>
<p>I’ve used it to make a simple function that gives the names of the functions in a Go file:</p>
<pre class="go"><code>package gofast

import (
    &quot;go/ast&quot;
    &quot;go/parser&quot;
    &quot;go/token&quot;
    &quot;log&quot;
)

func Gofast( code string ) []string {
  fset := token.NewFileSet()
    node, err := parser.ParseFile(fset, &quot;&quot;, code, parser.ParseComments)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

  functions := []string{} ;

    ast.Inspect(node, func(n ast.Node) bool {
        // Find Functions
        fn, ok := n.(*ast.FuncDecl)
        if ok {
            functions = append( functions, fn.Name.Name )
        }
        return true
    })

  return functions
}</code></pre>
<p>So we have the <code>Gofast</code> function that takes some code in a string and return a slice of strings.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the first problem, we want to call this function from R, so we want to be able to return a slice of strings as an R character vector. We need a few tools from the R api. - <code>Rf_allocVector</code> to create a vector of the right type, here <code>STRSXP</code> - <code>Rf_protect</code> to protect that vector from the garbage collector - <code>Rf_unprotect</code> to lift that protection - <code>SET_STRING_ELT</code> to set an individual R string (i.e. a <code>CHARSXP</code>) in the vector - <code>Rf_mkCharLenCE</code> to create an R string from a sequence of <code>char</code> and a size.</p>
<p>So following the pattern I’ve used in my previous go adventures, here is another Go function that sits between the real pure go code we’ve seen before, and the R things. Don’t worry if it looks ugly, it involves both low level stuff from Go and R apis.</p>
<pre class="go"><code>package main

/*
  #define USE_RINTERNALS
  #include &lt;R.h&gt;
  #include &lt;Rinternals.h&gt;

*/
import &quot;C&quot;
import &quot;gofast&quot;

//export Gofast
func Gofast( x string ) C.SEXP {
  functions := gofast.Gofast(x)
  n := len(functions)

  var out C.SEXP = C.Rf_allocVector( C.STRSXP, C.long(n) )
  C.Rf_protect(out)
  defer C.Rf_unprotect(1)

  for i, s := range functions {
    C.SET_STRING_ELT( out, C.R_xlen_t(i), C.Rf_mkCharLenCE( C._GoStringPtr(s), C.int(len(s)), C.CE_UTF8 ) )
  }

  return out ;
}

func main() {}</code></pre>
<p>This starts nicely by calling the other <code>Gofast</code> function to get the slice of strings <code>functions := gofast.Gofast(x)</code> and then the rest of it is just mitigating R and Go low level interfaces. I found out about <code>C._GoStringPtr</code> by asking <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49453875/access-the-raw-bytes-of-a-string">this question</a> on stack overflow.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of <code>ergo</code> is that we will not have to care about that as eventually it will be generated automatically.</p>
<p>We also need an R api compatible C function, i.e. a function that only used <code>SEXP</code> in and out. It’s a bit less intimidating than the other one, although I would not want to write this one manually either, I did, but I’m weird.</p>
<pre class="c"><code>#include &quot;_cgo_export.h&quot;

SEXP gofast( SEXP x ){
  if( TYPEOF(x) != STRSXP ) error(&quot;expecting an string&quot;) ;
  SEXP sx = STRING_ELT(x, 0) ;
  GoString gos = { (char*)CHAR(sx), SHORT_VEC_LENGTH(sx) } ;
  return Gofast(gos) ;
}</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need an R function to call <code>gofast</code>, it looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; @useDynLib gofast
#&#39; @export
gofast &lt;- function(x) {
  .Call(&quot;gofast&quot;, x, PACKAGE = &quot;gofast&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<p>and then finally we can all it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>code &lt;- &#39;
package foo 

func Test() int{ return 3 } 
func Bla(){}
&#39;
gofast::gofast(code)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Test&quot; &quot;Bla&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If we take a step back from all the layers, we started from a Go function that takes a single string and returns a slice of strings and we call that function from R.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that function’s job is to list the Go functions in the Go file. This is just a first step, down the line, we’ll be able to get more information from the ast and use it to generate all the boiler plate intermediate functions. It’s been done with Rcpp from an approximate parser, so there’s no reason why this can’t be done too with exact parsing from Go.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished, I have some more confidence about the potential of <code>ergo</code>. The code discussed here is in the <a href="https://github.com/rstats-go/gofast">gofast</a> repo in the <a href="https://github.com/rstats-go">rstats-go</a> organisation we created to structure the development of <code>ergo</code>.</p>
