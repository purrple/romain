<h2>dplyr mondays</h2>
<p>I’ll be working on <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr">dplyr</a> on at least mondays for the next few weeks.
One day a week is a strong commitment, but having it set in stone in my agenda will help me
commit to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr">dplyr</a> is definitely the best project I’ve had the chance to work on
professionally. I can’t help but feel somewhat ashamed about disappearing on it for no reason that I
can fully explain myself. I know however that once I feel bad, it makes it much harder to
come back or even simply reach out, especially online.</p>
<p>The success of <a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org">dplyr</a> is well established, and the project certainly has matured.
Having a conversation about dplyr between the four authors at <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">rstudio::conf</a>
was definitely one of my personnal highlights from the conference. This might be an oversimplification
but in essence <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham">Hadley</a> continued to lead,
<a href="https://twitter.com/_lionelhenry">Lionel</a> added tidy evaluation, and
<a href="https://twitter.com/krlmlr">Kirill</a> took over the various back ends, e.g. the data frame back end
I initially worked on.</p>
<p>It turns out <a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org">dplyr</a> still needs me, so <code>#dplyrmondays</code> are an attempt to
structure some of my time to commit (and hopefully 😆 push) to <code>dplyr</code>.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first iteration of <code>#dplyrmondays</code>. As much as I’m always eager to
invent new things and discover uncharted territories, this is not something you do on day 0,
so I’ve used my time to look at a few <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues">issues</a>.</p>
<p>I opened one <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/3392">issue</a> related to the <code>BH</code>
📦 and opened 4 ⬇️ requests.</p>
<p><img src="/img/dplyrmondays/pull_requests.png" /></p>
<p>One of <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/pull/3394">them</a> in particular led to flushing
out an insidious bug that I first <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/broom/issues/287">attributed</a>
to <code>broom::augment</code>, but then the 🏀 was bounced back to the
<code>stats::model.frame</code> function. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MichaelChirico">Michael Chirico</a> for promoting it to
an <a href="http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/model-frame-strips-class-as-promised-but-fails-to-strip-OBJECT-in-C-td4748687.html">R-devel thread</a>, I only did
the lazy thing and 🐦ed about it.</p>
{{< tweet "970664676467052544" >}}
<p>Four issues (and then some comments to other issues) feels minimal, but this includes
getting back on track with the codebase and setup a more formal way of contributing,
i.e. through pull requests, reviews, and systematic testing.</p>
<p>Today is another day, so I’ll work on another project. See you next monday.</p>
