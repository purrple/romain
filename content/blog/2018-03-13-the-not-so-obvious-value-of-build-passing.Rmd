## dplyr monday, week 2

Yesterday was my second iteration of `#dplyrmondays`, a schedule I'm trying to 
respect to give clarity about when I'm working on `dplyr`. 

`r blogdown::shortcode_html("tweet", "973104251479175168")`

So, there is some going back to last week's issues and pending pull requests, 
follow ups on [Kirill](https://twitter.com/krlmlr) comments, generally 
`r emo::ji("swim")` the code base to prepare for a `r emo::ji("call")` with 
[Kirill](https://twitter.com/krlmlr) and [Lionel](https://twitter.com/_lionelhenry) 
in the afternoon. 

## The insidious build-passed

The thing I wanted to do first is to bring the repo back to a <img src="/img/build-passing.png" />
travis badge. This is a nice way to motivate users who want to give a shot at testing 
the development version, and it's a nice reward. 

However, that's not why I wanted to work on this first. The reason is that having 
a <img src="/img/travis/build-failing.png" /> is a perfect back door for more problems 
down the line. 

I survived all of [last week's monday](https://purrple.cat/blog/2018/03/06/first-dplyr-mondays/)
with a <img src="/img/travis/build-failing.png" /> on the master branch, I did not pay too much 
attention and wanted to start fixing things that were already `reprex`ed in 
issues so nicely crafted by the community `r emo::ji("folded_hands")`. 

First of all, you keep receiving these *Still failing* emails from Travis, and sometimes 
I can't help it but interpret this as an allegory of life. I just spent some time fixing 
a problem, I don't want a reminder that I'm still failing.

The real problem however is that because you know it was broken already, you just don't pay attention
so you don't have a way to quickly assert if you have just added a new `r emo::ji("ladybug")`, and 
then you live in fear. 

This is also a problem for the person who reviews the contribution, might be you, might not be you, that's irrelevant. 
The last thing you want is to give more work to someone, especially if that someone is you.

It turns out the problem was trivial enough, it was just a matter of finding the 
information in the travis logs and follow R's recommendation for the 
interface that `.onDetach` expects.

## Next steps

Great, now [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) has its <img src="/img/travis/build-passing.png" />
badge again and I can break things again, or at least we can quickly identify when I do so. 

Other things happened yesterday, but that's enough words about it. 

I might start to think about ways to make it easier to extract information from 
travis. It's a lot of scrolling right now and it might be the reason why sometimes
we don't fix things quickly enough.
