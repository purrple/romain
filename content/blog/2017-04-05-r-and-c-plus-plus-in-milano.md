I was in Milano with the [team](www.thinkr.fr) yesterday,
for my second time as a speaker at the [MilanoR meetup](http://www.milanor.net/blog/).
I gave a talk about R and C++ roughly split in two parts : where we are,
and where I'd like to go next with the R and C++ integration.

For the occasion, I was wearing my `%>%` t-shirt and my
dear stalker Sherlock Holmes hat.

Before the meetup, we spent a few days visiting around
lake Como, lake Maggiore, and of course we had
lots of coffee, ice cream, spritz and pizza. One of our Airbnb in Genoa
even had R-branded toilet paper.
