## TL;DR

This is a very personal post where I'm articulating some thoughts about my career so far, 
my immediate shift of direction, and how you can [help me](https://www.patreon.com/romainfrancois). 
I'm typically not a disclaimer user because I believe it's pretty obvious I'm speaking in my own name, but let me for once
express that I have a lot of respect for the companies I worked for, 
and that I take full responsaibility for any flaws I'm about to discuss here. 

My contract with [ThinkR](https://thinkr.fr) has ended on feb 23rd, and I'm now repurposing 
my time to focus exclusively on open source work. I'll discuss that in details below, 
but for now, here's a link to my [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/romainfrancois)
where you have an opportunity to help me stay free and work serenely on cool open source stuff. 

## Once upon a time

I was a bright kid, and everybody in the family was surprised when I picked up reading on my own
(that's at least the story I've heard manby times), 
after some tests I skipped two classes and things still were easy. I'm not writing this to brag, 
quite the opposite. I attribute most of character traits and flaws to essentially 
surviving through school being two years younger than everybody else.

I did not really pay too much attention in school because things were easy, I just knew
how to do the bare minimum, at the end of high school I knew I would pass because I was solid in maths, 
so I did not bother doing the second page of the physics exam. Things like that. 

I kind of went with the flow of what I liked and knew how to do, so I ended up doing maths 
in grad school in [Aix en Provence](http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com) and 
[Montpellier](http://www.montpellier.fr). 

But there was only so much abstract maths I could cope with, so after failing one year
while discovering stand up comedy, I was guided towards stats and this changed everything. 
I might not be able to stretch that metaphor too far, but `r emo::ji("mic")`
and stats are two sides of the same coin for me. In both you collect large amount of data, 
and you translate it to something interesting, sometimes it's `r emo::ji("thinking")`, 
sometimes it's `r emo::ji("rofl")`, same thing. Too bad there's no `comedyverse`. 

## The R magnet

I first learned about [R](https://www.r-project.org) in Montpellier for a homework 
assignment about PCA with the `state.x77` dataset. The assignment was in S+, which was
installed in the university machines, but the professor 
handed us what felt like a contraband `r emo::ji("cd")` of something that looked like S+. This 
was R one point something. 

Later that year we went to [CIRAD](https://www.cirad.fr) with a few classmates to download 
a more recent copy of R and most of CRAN, in particular we wanted the 
[akima](https://cran.r-project.org/package=akima) `r emo::ji("package")` for a 
spatial statistics assignment. 

I never really took the time to think about it, but I guess these two assignments
are what got me interrested in R in the first place. This is when I started to 
check what's inside, digest lots of documentation and code, register to the mailing list, 
R was like a big magnet I was attracted to, and even though the community was perhaps not 
as welcoming as it has become now, I wanted to be a part of it. 
The more I knew, the more I wanted to know ... I'm in my early 20ies, and this is the first time
I work hard for something, no matter what the difficulty was, I developped this passion 
about R, and open source in general, but mostly R. 

I finished my curriculum at the [ISUP](http://isup.sorbonne-universite.fr/fr/index.html), 
but I still feel that the university in Montpellier already equipped me with the tools 
I needed. ISUP is one of the oldest schools of statistics, and it did carry a lot
of baggage at the time. I remember being furious about the absence of R in the program, 
to the point that I felt I had to teach it to my classmates, so I organized like an 
underground training session in the computer room. Everybody chipped in and they offered
me two tickets to go see a play in a nice theater in Paris. 

Whenever there was an assignment in SAS or whatever, I would essentially discard that 
piece of information, and do it in R instead. R was going to be a huge part of my life. 

Also, the curriculum was very geared towards theoretical statistics, lots of ink and 
paper, e.g. I thought I knew what bootstrap was (for loops and resampling and cool 
graphics) so I was not ready for that deluge of theory around it. In a way, I 
guess I was already choosing data science. 

I've heard things are better now, but I'm not sure what to believe about the airquotes around 
*data science* in the front page. 

[![](/img/job/data-science.png)](http://isup.sorbonne-universite.fr/fr/index.html)

For my internship at the end of ISUP, I worked with [inria](https://www.inria.fr) on 
improving [mixmod](http://www.mixmod.org/?lang=fr). This is how I learned C++. This 
was not really a stats internship, this did not really involve R, this was more like a
computer science internship. In the context of ISUP, I was setting myself up 
for failure by going through with this internship. One of the professors took it way too 
personally and rejected my defense of this internship 
the first time. Everybody thought I was joking when I announced that I failed, 
that did not really help with the pain. I did it again a few weeks later with less
lines of code in the slides and more lines of maths, and I passed with flying colors. 

## Not a Doctor

After that, amputed of some self confidence and without giving it much thought, and also 
being busy preparing for the arrival of my first `r emo::ji("baby")`, I accepted to 
carry on with the same team and embarked *no questions asked* on the way to a thesis
on a different topic. This was a terrible plan. Not being able to say *no* is generally a very bad idea. 
I don't think I should be a source of wisdom, but here we go: 

> Learn to say no. Use that skill often.

The 10 months this lasted were very hard on me, I felt stuck between the 
university and the industry partner, constantly going from one office to 
another and act as a messenger. I don't think I did anything of any value 
during these few months. 

> Think about what you like, and do that. 

My daughter was born and I was getting a sense of accomplishment through 
the R graph gallery, a website I put together to showcase graphics 
produced by R alongside the code. This was lots of very fragile php code
on top of a mysql database and poor web design, but people liked it.
This would have been sooooo much nicer if 
[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) existed at the time. 

The deployment was such a pain too, I had to enter things for new 
graphics in a mysql database, and update the site through ftp. 
It lived in a *real* server to run the php code, at some point 
during one my my disappearing episodes, I forgot
to renew it so the last version essentially vanished. Life 
is so much sweater now with things like 
[github](https://github.com) and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com). 

I might be able 
to find it again, but [Yan Holtz](https://holtzyan.wordpress.com) 
picked the project and he is now maintaining 
a version on top of wordpress. 

Anyway, through some `r emo::ji("top_hat")` `r emo::ji( "rabbit2")`, I was 
attending [useR! 2006](https://www.r-project.org/conferences/useR-2006/) 
in Vienna with a poster about my work on mixmod. 
Life changing experience, useR was much smaller at the time but still this was 
quite intimidating, and you already had the feeling of being bombarded with 
information, new things to learn. 

## Consulting

Overall, the conference was reinforcing my desire to be part of the community, 
some people knew about the graph gallery, so I talked more about it than about my poster. 
This is also where I met with people from [Mango](https://www.mango-solutions.com). I was like 
*wait, I can write R code all day and be paid for it, that sounds cool*. That sounded 
better than what I was doing. I didn't think about it twice. 

A few months `r emo::ji("fast_forward")`, I was in a pub in Chippenham doing an interview. 
We moved to [Bath](https://visitbath.co.uk) with a 6 months old `r emo::ji("baby")`, and apparently 
I was a consultant now. 

This was my first real job, I travelled to many places, attended conferences, learned a lot of 
things, most of what I know about being a consultant comes from the two years at this job, most 
of the struggles too. Not too much open source, although I was quite extreme about *using* 
open source as much as possible. Dumping windows to install some funky (or maybe even not that funky)
linux distribution was a good way in 2006 to create some friction with people and software. 

I only took me 2 years to develop enough anxiety to break down, and again that is totally on me, 
mango was a small (6 when I joined, twice that when I left) company, people were nice and friendly,
we went to the pub frequently and played Badminton, they were super helpful for the whole 
expat with a baby process. 

What triggered the break down was that I had to organize an *Advanced R Training Course*. I 
did not know what it meant, I still don't really know, but in my head it meant something 
I'm not good enough to deliver, it meant people are going to ask me questions I won't have answers
for, it meant I was going to make a fool of myself. And learning more stuff for such an occasion 
might not be a good plan, because essentially the more you learn, the more you realize how much 
more you need to learn, and this is daunting in the process of teaching advanced professionnal 
expert level *(add yours)* training. Don't get me wrong though, learning more stuff is 
generally a good idea, but not really when you do it as part of preparing one of the millions 
things you think you have to master tomorrow. 

I really enjoy when I'm a room with people transmitting things that I know about R, but at the same time
preparing the materials is something I *always* struggle with, always, no matter the topic, no matter 
how much I know about it. Knowing something and be able to teach it are two very different games. 

I took some time off, but I did not really recover, and we kind of wanted our daughter to go to a french school. 
So we came back to France, and I was like *Ok, so I'll just do the same exact thing, consulting and training*
but as an independent freelancer, how hard could it be, right ? Mango was super helpful in the 
transition process, they even gave me an extra gig. My former employer was my first client, that was nice. 

I also had a few contacts, this materialised to few consulting contracts. And anyway, the worst come the worst 
I can always go hunt for a job. I was very naive to believe that I could pull it off. On top of not being 
a consultant (more on that below), dealing with paperwork, invoices, spending time on the phone, 
estimate the time something will take me, multiply that by two, but still be way off, 
come up with how much I think my time is worth, ... I was not ready for any of that. 

By some miracle, this lasted 8 years, and let's just say it has not been the best financial journey, I was structureless, 
not really giving careful thought about the job. Not thinking is kind of a pattern of me, I just realized it now
because of *thinking* about it, that's refreshing. 

> Think

I've had some nice projects as a freelancer, organized a few training sessions, 
travelled to many places again, but for the most part, when you do consulting, 
not only you work on projects you don't choose,
but on top of that you work on something someone else did not want to do. Sometimes 
you're lucky and that's a nice project, sometimes you might learn something from it,
but most of the time you'd rather be doing something else. 

## Open source Asylum

For me, that was seeking asylum in open source projects, I already developped a taste
for connecting R with other languages, that started with Java. My first trip to the 
land of the R internals was because of [rJava](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rJava). I liked 
the `r emo::ji("package")` but the jni inspired low level interface was a bit hard to grasp, so I helped
with the reflection based api with the `J` function and the use of the `$` method to 
access fields and methods. 

I discovered Google's [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and 
I liked it, that usually means I'm likely to do a package about it, and I could reuse 
things that I learned from working on `rJava`. `protobuf` has a C++ library, so it was very natural 
to use it to bring them to R. There was a thing called `Rcpp` that existed at the time, 
so I started using it to build `RProtoBuf`. 

[Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) was not what it is today, 
data was copied on the way in from R objects to C++ structures, like
`std::vector<double>` and on the way back from the C++ structures to R objects, the interface was
weird, all the classes started with the `Rcpp` prefix, ... anyway there was a lot to be unhappy about. 

Again, thanks to previous work on `RJava`, I knew about 
[`R_PreserveObject` and `R_ReleaseObject`](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/0ba66a2bc236ae5b009af910688575aa4adddd2c/src/include/Rinternals.h#L1272), 
and starting to use them is one of the two best things that ever happened to `Rcpp`
(the other one being attributes from [JJ](https://twitter.com/fly_upside_down) ). 

```cpp
/* preserve objects across GCs */
void R_PreserveObject(SEXP);
void R_ReleaseObject(SEXP);
```

That changed everything, we could now have nice syntax, without paying for expensive
data copies. When an `Rcpp` object (e.g. a `NumericVector`) is constructed, its underlying R object 
goes through `R_PreserveObject` to protect it from the garbage collector, and when the 
object is destructed, a call is made to `R_ReleaseObject` to remove that protection. 

I ended up working almost full time on Rcpp for several months, and 
then users started to show up so we had to support them through mailing list and stack overflow
and things like that. That's a lot of work. I liked it, I did not really pay 
attention to the fact that I was essentially doing all this work for free. For sure
down the line, I organised a few training sessions about `Rcpp` and I had some contracts 
around it, but I think it is fair to say that I never really got return on my time 
investment on the project. We did not really know that this was going to power many 
cran packages at the time. 

Developping `Rcpp` was for me a way to learn about R internals and C++ at the same time, 
while doing something that would be generally useful to others. I usually try to 
install some community side effects when I learn something. 

And then this happened. 

[![](/img/job/stack-overflow-hadley-R-C.png)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4106174/where-can-i-learn-how-to-write-c-code-to-speed-up-slow-r-functions)

I believe answering that question from [Hadley](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) on stack overflow had a huge 
impact on a personnal level for sure, but also most importantly on the community. 2010 was a pre-dplyr pre-magrittr-pipe
R world, and `plyr` was running the show. I never really got on the `plyr` `r emo::ji( "bullet_train")`, catching Hadley's
attention about `Rcpp` is one of the things that led to [`dplyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr). 

Working on `dplyr` is definitely the best thing that ever happened to me. There were clear goals, but 
a lot of freedom for the implementation, since speed was high on the list, I naturally 
ended up using a lot (too much perhaps) of `Rcpp`. And `r emo::ji("cherry")` on the `r emo::ji("cake")`, 
I could invoice my time. 

## I'm not a consultant

I still had private consulting projects, but then a weird pattern started to emerge. In short, 
I lost interest in the private consulting projects, so these projects would greatly 
slow me down and build anxiety. I still had to deliver them, and somehow that led 
to a time black `r emo::ji("hole")`, all my time was going in there for almost no results, 
or a very slow `r emo::ji("snail")` progress. 

Then the feeling of guilt, why would I be allowed to work on cool (paid nor not paid)
projects while I was feeling guilty of not being able to make progress on the others. 
I then ended up spending less and less time on the things that I liked 
because the things I didn't were resultlessly eating all of it. 

Eventually the cool projects were too far, and I could not find the energy to get back at 
them, and the shame of having disappeared did not help me reaching out, all I would have had to offer
was excuses, sorry I've been busy and all that. shame. 

Being late at delivering also means no money, no stability etc ... and feeding 
my imposter syndrome `r emo::ji("demon")`. 

The job offer from ThinkR felt like a blessing, I would have a salary, people
to interract with, challenging work, and a 80/20 setup so that I could spend 20% 
of my time on whatever. I has been a nice adventure, the job is interresting and 
the company is ubiquitous in the `r emo::ji("france")` R community, something 
I've never been able to do on my own. 

The old demons were still present though, I can only blame myself for that, 
but that gluttoned my 20%. I'm not saying I've not been present and encouraged 
to be during my year, e.g. event though I did not get to go to [useR!](https://user2017.brussels) last year
for `r emo::ji("baby")` reasons, I have been active on twitter, which triggered 
curiosity about emojis, planting the seed of future work on the `emo` `r emo::ji("package")`. 

Community-me was trying to get out, that twitter activity led to 
the [tweetstorm](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/tweetstorm) shiny app (I only realized later 
that the word meant something else), which we then used in shiny training courses. 
Same story with the [prenoms](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/prenoms) package, the 
shiny app about the french [legislatives](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/legislatives2017) 
elections, the [collage](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/collage) package, which were 
then a part of how I would build training material. 

This was more evenings and weekends than 20% though, because I did not manage to do 
what I wanted, and was supposed, to do with my 80%, and depending on the projects 
on my plate, I would end up being late and exhausted at the end of 80% anyway. 

## So what now

Again, that's all on me, but having spent some time to think about it (yeah I do that now), 
I'm forced to realize that being a private consultant is not what I am, 
and not what I want to be, and for the most part if I believe the conversations
I typically have at conferences, not really what is expected of me. 

My initial one-year contract ended a month ago, and I chose to not renew it, so that I can 
take over control of my time. But this time, I'm putting a lot of thoughts into 
what I want to do with it. 

Some people do open source on the side, some people are lucky enough to work 
for companies that have a very strong commitment to open source. Apart from that,
two patterns that I see a lot are 
 - build an open resume, build enough of a github streak to weight in at some future 
   job application. 
 - rewards. I did good on my day job, I'll reward myself with some open source work, 
   I'll have a nice feeling about giving back. 

Although I think at some points I've matched these patterns, I now believe that 
open source work is neither a stepping stone nor a treat, but real day job kind of work. 

My goal now is to spend 100% of my time doing open source work. 
I've been thinking about this a lot, so here's how I am organizing my weeks now: 

 - on monday, I'll work on [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr). There's 
  still plenty of work to do here, for now I've been dealing with issues and bugs, 
  but eventually there is still room for innovation. 
  
 - on tuesday, I'll work on [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow), to 
  add R as one of the supported languages, following the steps of the python front end. 

 - on friday, I'll work on [ergo](https://github.com/rstats-go), to bridge R and  
   [go](https://golang.org). For now that means writing a proposal to get funding. 

This has worked well so far. It involves some context switching, but forcing myself 
to block these days gives me enough focus. 

That leaves wednesday and thursday that are not associated with strong commitments, 
I'll use these days to get involved in miscellaneous projects, not necessarily my own. 

## Help

I have setup a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/romainfrancois) page to give the 
community a way to help me stay free, and continue to get involved in open source 
projects with some serenity. 

[![](/img/job/confettis.png)](https://www.patreon.com/romainfrancois)

I totally understand that this is not for everyone, and that's fine. I don't live in the
illusion that I can make an income out of this, but at least this offers a
concrete possibility for people or companies to chip in. I believe I'm much more useful 
to the community when I'm free.

I know we have now more formal ways to get funding, but these typically 
are *project* oriented, you write a project proposal, you submit it and perhaps
you get some funding. This is what I will do for `ergo`, but this does 
not apply to miscellaneous small projects and various efforts to support the community. 

Platforms such as patreon are *people* oriented, and are better match for 
supporting someone who works creatively, you support someone's process instead of the 
end result. 

Every donation is welcome and useful, I arbitrarily setup donation suggestions as powers of 2 (`2^(0:10)`) with emoji 
titles and some indication of what you'd help me cover. The first few goals I've 
setup are all about covering expenses related to how I work, things like internet connection 
and renting a space in a coworking office. 

I want to believe in that setup, 3 days a week with strong commitments to 3 
important projects, and the remaining two days with more freedom to 
be involved in miscellaneous projects and communities.
