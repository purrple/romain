<div id="strings-are-arrays-of-bytes" class="section level2">
<h2>Strings are arrays of bytes</h2>
<p>Strings are <em>hard</em>, especially when you start to add concepts like encoding and
locales, etc ‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs not what we are talking about here. Let‚Äôs ‚è™.</p>
<p>Strings are <em>simple</em>, they are just a consecutive sequences of characters, let‚Äôs keep
hiding a lot under the carpet üôä,
strings are just a (null terminated) array of bytes. The length of the string is the number of
non null bytes.</p>
<p>A simple way to get that information in C would be a loop (it‚Äôs ok to write loops in C).</p>
<pre class="c"><code>int string_length( const char* s){
  int n = 0 ;
  for( char* p = s; *p != 0; p++) n++ ;
  return n ;
}
string_length( &quot;head, shoulders, knees and toes&quot;) ;</code></pre>
<p>This just counts the number of bytes (aka <code>char</code>) in the string, obviously in real life
what a character is is more complicated than a <code>byte</code><span class="note">some characters, like say emojis are
made of several bytes</span>, but we said this was another day‚Äôs problem.</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt have to write the loop manually because we know about the
C function <code>strlen</code> ;</p>
<pre class="c"><code>strlen( &quot;head, shoulders, knees and toes&quot; ) ;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="what-about-r-strings" class="section level2">
<h2>What about R strings</h2>
<p>You don‚Äôt typically see individual strings in R because R has no
notion of scalars, you see character vectors of length one, perhaps through
the <code>Rcpp::CharacterVector</code> class.</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt see them, but they exist internally as one of the SEXP types, namely <code>CHARSXP</code>.
When you have a character vector (a <code>STRSXP</code>) and you want a single string (a <code>CHARSXP</code>)
you may use the <code>STRING_ELT</code> macro.</p>
<p>Then if you want the actual string, you can use the <code>CHAR</code> macro.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Rcpp::cppFunction( &#39;
int rstring_length_strlen( SEXP sv ){
  SEXP s = STRING_ELT(sv, 0) ;
  return strlen( CHAR(s) ) ;
}
&#39;)
s &lt;- &quot;head, shoulders, knees and toes&quot;
rstring_length_strlen( s )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 31</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>nchar(s)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 31</code></pre>
<p>But <code>CHAR</code> is not the only thing you can do to a <code>CHARSXP</code>, you can also
use the <code>LENGTH</code> macro, which retrieves information that is stored in the <code>SEXP</code>
alonside the actual string, so R strings already know their length.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Rcpp::cppFunction( &#39;
int rstring_length_LENGTH( SEXP sv ){
  SEXP s = STRING_ELT(sv, 0) ;
  return LENGTH( s ) ;
}
&#39;)
rstring_length_LENGTH( s )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 31</code></pre>

<h2>Back story</h2>
<p>This might be an obscure post, it‚Äôs been on this <a href="https://github.com/purrple/website/issues/1">blog issues</a> for a while now. I guess
I‚Äôve not materialised it yet is because of my conception that this is either known
by people for which this relevant, or it is not relevant to other people. Either
you already know, or you don‚Äôt have to care.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll try to force myself to write about these types of things when I can identify that
at some point in the past, I would have benefited from knowing and I did not.</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs quite the case, otherwise the <code>size</code> method of <a href="https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/blob/29f28c45c9a9aa33755a79f368f7158de4d2a49a/inst/include/Rcpp/String.h"><code>Rcpp::String</code></a> would use
<code>length</code> when in fact there isn‚Äôt even a <code>size</code> method üò±.</p>
