<h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>This year's <a href="http://www.RinFinance.com">R/Finance conference</a> will be
  preceded by a full-day masterclass on <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> and related topics which will be
  held on Thursday, April 28, 2011, the Univ. of Illinois at Chicago campus.</p>

  <p>Join <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/">Dirk Eddelbuettel</a> and  <a href="https://purrple.cat/">Romain Francois</a> for six hours of detailed and
  hands-on instructions and discussions around Rcpp, inline, RInside,
  RcppArmadillo and other packages---in intimate small-group setting.</p>

  <p>The full-day format allows to combine a morning introductory session with a
  more advanced afternoon session while leaving room for sufficient breaks.
  There will be about six hours of instructions, a one-hour lunch break and
  two half-hour coffee breaks.</p>


 <h2>Morning session: "A hands-on introduction to R and C++"</h2>

  <p>The morning session will provide a practical introduction to the Rcpp
  package (and other related packages).  The focus will be on simple and
  straightforward applications of Rcpp in order to extend R and/or
  to significantly accelerate the execution of simple functions.</p>

 <p>The tutorial will cover the inline package which permits embedding of
  self-contained C, C++ or Fortran code in R scripts. We will also discuss
  RInside to embed R code in C++ applications, as well as standard Rcpp
  extension packages such as RcppArmadillo for linear algebra and RcppGSL.</p>


 <h2>Afternoon session: "Advanced R and C++ topics"</h2>

<p>This afternoon tutorial will provide a hands-on introduction to more
  advanced Rcpp features. It will cover topics such as writing packages that
  use Rcpp, how 'Rcpp modules' and the new R ReferenceClasses interact, and
  how 'Rcpp sugar' lets us write C++ code that is often as expressive as R
  code. Another possible topic, time permitting, may be writing glue code to
  extend Rcpp to other C++ projects.</p>

 <p>We also hope to leave some time to discuss problems brought by the class
  participants.</p>


  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

  <p>Knowledge of R as well as general programming knowledge; C or C++ knowledge
  is helpful but not required.</p>

  <p>Users should bring a laptop set up so that R packages can be built. That
  means on Windows, Rtools needs to be present and working, and on OS X the
  Xcode package should be installed.</p>
