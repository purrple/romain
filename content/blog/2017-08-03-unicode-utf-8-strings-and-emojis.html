<p>I‚Äôve been somewhat obsessing about emojis lately, it all started when I wanted to check which emojis were used <a href="http://purrple.cat/blog/2017/07/11/emojis-at-user2017/">on twitter</a> during useR this year.</p>
{{< tweet 883199852347367424 >}}
<p>But this post is not really about emojis, because my <a href="https://github.com/ThinkRstat/emojitsu">emojitsu</a> package is not ready yet, but here‚Äôs a preview anyway.</p>
{{< tweet 892375718247706626 >}}
<p>So I‚Äôll blog specifically about emojis later, but this has led me to digress down the üêá hole, because emojis are made of unicode runes typically encoded into utf-8 strings. Most of the concepts in that last sentence were quite mysterious to me not so long ago, and I believe we should collectively know more about unicode and utf-8. I learned some of the basics from the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/strings">Strings, bytes, runes and characters in Go</a> post in the go blog, and <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a>.</p>
<p>Typically when I want to understand something, I make an R üì¶. For example a few years ago I wanted to understand C++. I guess I really want to understand this, as I am making not 1, not 2 but 3 üì¶ (if I count <code>emojitsu</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uni</code> : contains a tibble of unicode runes</li>
<li><code>utf8splain</code> : to get to the 0 and 1 of utf-8 string encoding</li>
<li><code>emojitsu</code> : grammar of emoji, or at least programmatic manipulation of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The üåê has changed now, and strings can no longer be considered as mere sequences of single characters (bytes). The <code>uni::code</code> tibble contains the 82719 unicode runes (aka code points). btw, the <a href="https://github.com/ThinkRstat/uni/blob/master/data-raw/unicode-table.R">generation of the <code>uni::code</code></a> tibble contains some interesting tidyverse ü§∏, perhaps I‚Äôll ‚úçÔ∏è another post about that, but let‚Äôs not digress more yet.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>uni::code</code></pre>

<p>So as of now, unicode has 82719 runes, that‚Äôs way more than the 256 that can fit into a single byte (8 bits), however we still want to be able to process text from back in the days when strings were in fact arrays of single bytes.</p>
<p>Unicode is just a giant map of characters, that covers all languages, emojis and other things I don‚Äôt know about, currently ranging between U+0000 and U+E01EF.</p>

<p>Each rune is just a number, and the job of utf-8 is to encode that number (i.e.¬†its bits) into a sequence of bytes. To do this, utf-8 uses a variable number of bytes.</p>
<p>For each rune: - If the first byte starts with a 0 bit, the rune only needs one byte, and uses the remaining 7 bits. Otherwise the number of leading 1 in the first byte indicate the number of bytes that the rune need. - The following bytes all start with ‚Äú10‚Äù - All the bits that are not used by this system are used to store the binary representation of the rune.</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot of words, so the <code>utf8splain::runes</code> function is here to help you.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶ and if you use a <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/crayon">crayon üñç</a> compatible console, like a recent enough (maybe a daily build) of rstudio, you even get colour:</p>
<p><img src="/img/utf8splain/runes-crayon.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The first 6 characters are just ascii ‚Äúh‚Äù, ‚Äúe‚Äù, ‚Äúl‚Äù, ‚Äúl‚Äù, ‚Äúo‚Äù and &quot; ‚Äú. They only need 7 bits, so they can be utf-8 encoded using just one byte.</p>
<p>The 7th rune üåç is the rune ‚ÄúU+1F30D‚Äù, i.e.¬†binary encoded as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>world_decimal &lt;- strtoi( &quot;0x1F30D&quot;, base = 16)
world_decimal</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 127757</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>world_binary    &lt;- paste( substr(as.character( rev(intToBits(world_decimal)) ), 2, 2 ), collapse = &quot;&quot; )
world_binary</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;00000000000000011111001100001101&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>world_binary_signif &lt;- sub( &quot;^0+&quot;, &quot;&quot;, world_binary )
world_binary_signif</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;11111001100001101&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>nchar(world_binary_signif)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 17</code></pre>
<p>It needs 17 bits, in terms of utf-8 it means it needs 4 bytes (in red). These 4 bytes contain the utf-8 machinery (the light gray bits) and the actual binary bits for the rune (in black). To go full ‚≠ïÔ∏è the <code>runes</code> function extracts the description of each rune with a <code>left_join</code> with the <code>uni::code</code> tibble .</p>
<p>Next time we‚Äôll see that some emojis actually use several runes, but until then I need to finish the <code>emojitsu</code>.</p>
