## dplyr mondays

I'll be working on [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) on at least mondays for the next few weeks. 
One day a week is a strong commitment, but having it set in stone in my agenda will help me 
commit to it. 

[dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) is definitely the best project I've had the chance to work on
professionally. I can't help but feel somewhat ashamed about disappearing on it for no reason that I 
can fully explain myself. I know however that once I feel bad, it makes it much harder to 
come back or even simply reach out, especially online. 

The success of [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) is well established, and the project certainly has matured. 
Having a conversation about dplyr between the four authors at [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/)
was definitely one of my personnal highlights from the conference. This might be an oversimplification
but in essence [Hadley](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) continued to lead, 
[Lionel](https://twitter.com/_lionelhenry) added tidy evaluation, and
[Kirill](https://twitter.com/krlmlr) took over the various back ends, especially the data frame back end
I initially worked on. 

It turns out [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) still needs me, so `#dplyrmondays` are an attempt to 
structure some of my time to commit (and hopfully `r emo::ji("laughing")` push) to `dplyr`.

Yesterday was the first iteration of `#dplyrmondays`. As much as I'm always eager to 
invent new things and discover uncharted territories, this is not something you do on day 0, 
so I've used my time to look at a few [issues](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues). 

I opened one [issue](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/3392) related to the `BH`
`r emo::ji("package")` and opened 4 `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` requests.

One of [them](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/pull/3394) in particular led to flushing 
out an insidious bug that I first [attributed](https://github.com/tidyverse/broom/issues/287) 
to `broom::augment`, but then the `r emo::ji("basketball")` was bounced back to the 
`stats::model.frame` function. Thanks to [Michael Chirico](https://github.com/MichaelChirico) for promoting it to 
an [R-devel thread](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/model-frame-strips-class-as-promised-but-fails-to-strip-OBJECT-in-C-td4748687.html), I only did 
the lazy thing and `r emo::ji( "bird")`ed about it.

Four issues (and then some comments to other issues) feels minimal, but this includes 
getting back on track with the codebase and setup a more formal way of contributing, 
i.e. through pull requests, reviews, and systematic testing. 

Today is another day, so I'll work on another project. See you next monday.
