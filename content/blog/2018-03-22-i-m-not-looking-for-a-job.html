<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>This is a very personal post where I‚Äôm articulating some thoughts about my career so far, my immediate shift of direction, and how you can <a href="https://www.patreon.com/romainfrancois">help me</a>. I‚Äôm typically not a disclaimer user because I believe it‚Äôs pretty obvious I‚Äôm speaking in my own name, but let me for once express that I have a lot of respect for the companies I worked for, and that I take full responsaibility for any flaws I‚Äôm about to discuss here.</p>
<p>My contract with <a href="https://thinkr.fr">ThinkR</a> has ended on feb 23rd, and I‚Äôm now repurposing my time to focus exclusively on open source work. I‚Äôll discuss that in details below, but for now, here‚Äôs a link to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/romainfrancois">patreon page</a> where you have an opportunity to help me stay free and work serenely on cool open source stuff.</p>

<div id="once-upon-a-time" class="section level2">
<h2>Once upon a time</h2>
<p>I was a bright kid, and everybody in the family was surprised when I picked up reading on my own (that‚Äôs at least the story I‚Äôve heard manby times), after some tests I skipped two classes and things still were easy. I‚Äôm not writing this to brag, quite the opposite. I attribute most of character traits and flaws to essentially surviving through school being two years younger than everybody else.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>I did not really pay too much attention in school because things were easy, I just knew how to do the bare minimum, at the end of high school I knew I would pass because I was solid in maths, so I did not bother doing the second page of the physics exam. Things like that.</p>
<p>I kind of went with the flow of what I liked and knew how to do, so I ended up doing maths in grad school in <a href="http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com">Aix en Provence</a> and <a href="http://www.montpellier.fr">Montpellier</a>.</p>
<p>But there was only so much abstract maths I could cope with, so after failing one year while discovering stand up comedy, I was guided towards stats and this changed everything. I might not be able to stretch that metaphor too far, but üé§ and stats are two sides of the same coin for me. In both you collect large amount of data, and you translate it to something interesting, sometimes it‚Äôs ü§î, sometimes it‚Äôs ü§£, same thing. Too bad there‚Äôs no <code>comedyverse</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-r-magnet" class="section level2">
<h2>The R magnet</h2>
<p>I first learned about <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> in Montpellier for a homework assignment about PCA with the <code>state.x77</code> dataset. The assignment was in S+, which was installed in the university machines, but the professor handed us what felt like a contraband üíø of something that looked like S+. This was R one point something.</p>
<p>Later that year we went to <a href="https://www.cirad.fr">CIRAD</a> with a few classmates to download a more recent copy of R and most of CRAN, in particular we wanted the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=akima">akima</a> üì¶ for a spatial statistics assignment.</p>
<p>I never really took the time to think about it, but I guess these two assignments are what got me interrested in R in the first place. This is when I started to check what‚Äôs inside, digest lots of documentation and code, register to the mailing list, R was like a big magnet I was attracted to, and even though the community was perhaps not as welcoming as it has become now, I wanted to be a part of it. The more I knew, the more I wanted to know ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in my early 20ies, and this is the first time I work hard for something, no matter what the difficulty was, I developped this passion about R, and open source in general, but mostly R.</p>
<p>I finished my curriculum at the <a href="http://isup.sorbonne-universite.fr/fr/index.html">ISUP</a>, but I still feel that the university in Montpellier already equipped me with the tools I needed. ISUP is one of the oldest schools of statistics, and it did carry a lot of baggage at the time. I remember being furious about the absence of R in the program, to the point that I felt I had to teach it to my classmates, so I organized like an underground training session in the computer room. Everybody chipped in and they offered me two tickets to go see a play in a nice theater in Paris.</p>
<p>Whenever there was an assignment in SAS or whatever, I would essentially discard that piece of information, and do it in R instead. R was going to be a huge part of my life.</p>
<p>Also, the curriculum was very geared towards theoretical statistics, lots of ink and paper, e.g.¬†I thought I knew what bootstrap was (for loops and resampling and cool graphics) so I was not ready for that deluge of theory around it. In a way, I guess I was already choosing data science.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve heard things are better now, but I‚Äôm not sure what to believe about the airquotes around <em>data science</em> in the front page.</p>
<p><a href="http://isup.sorbonne-universite.fr/fr/index.html"><img src="/img/job/data-science.png" /></a></p>
<p>For my internship at the end of ISUP, I worked with <a href="https://www.inria.fr">inria</a> on improving <a href="http://www.mixmod.org/?lang=fr">mixmod</a>. This is how I learned C++. This was not really a stats internship, this did not really involve R, this was more like a computer science internship. In the context of ISUP, I was setting myself up for failure by going through with this internship. One of the professors took it way too personally and rejected my defense of this internship the first time. Everybody thought I was joking when I announced that I failed, that did not really help with the pain. I did it again a few weeks later with less lines of code in the slides and more lines of maths, and I passed with flying colors.</p>

<div id="not-a-doctor" class="section level2">
<h2>Not a Doctor</h2>
<p>After that, amputed of some self confidence and without giving it much thought, and also being busy preparing for the arrival of my first üë∂, I accepted to carry on with the same team and embarked <em>no questions asked</em> on the way to a thesis on a different topic. This was a terrible plan. Not being able to say <em>no</em> is generally a very bad idea. I don‚Äôt think I should be a source of wisdom, but here we go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learn to say no. Use that skill often.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 10 months this lasted were very hard on me, I felt stuck between the university and the industry partner, constantly going from one office to another and act as a messenger. I don‚Äôt think I did anything of any value during these few months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about what you like, and do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My daughter was born and I was getting a sense of accomplishment through the R graph gallery, a website I put together to showcase graphics produced by R alongside the code. This was lots of very fragile php code on top of a mysql database and poor web design, but people liked it. This would have been sooooo much nicer if <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> existed at the time.</p>
<p>The deployment was such a pain too, I had to enter things for new graphics in a mysql database, and update the site through ftp. It lived in a <em>real</em> server to run the php code, at some point during one my my disappearing episodes, I forgot to renew it so the last version essentially vanished. Life is so much sweater now with things like <a href="https://github.com">github</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com">netlify</a>.</p>
<p>I might be able to find it again, but <a href="https://holtzyan.wordpress.com">Yan Holtz</a> picked the project and he is now maintaining a version on top of wordpress.</p>
<p>Anyway, through some üé© üêá, I was attending <a href="https://www.r-project.org/conferences/useR-2006/">useR! 2006</a> in Vienna with a poster about my work on mixmod. Life changing experience, useR was much smaller at the time but still this was quite intimidating, and you already had the feeling of being bombarded with information, new things to learn.</p>
</div>
<div id="consulting" class="section level2">
<h2>Consulting</h2>
<p>Overall, the conference was reinforcing my desire to be part of the community, some people knew about the graph gallery, so I talked more about it than about my poster. This is also where I met with people from <a href="https://www.mango-solutions.com">Mango</a>. I was like <em>wait, I can write R code all day and be paid for it, that sounds cool</em>. That sounded better than what I was doing. I didn‚Äôt think about it twice.</p>
<p>A few months ‚è©, I was in a pub in Chippenham doing an interview. We moved to <a href="https://visitbath.co.uk">Bath</a> with a 6 months old üë∂, and apparently I was a consultant now.</p>
<p>This was my first real job, I travelled to many places, attended conferences, learned a lot of things, most of what I know about being a consultant comes from the two years at this job, most of the struggles too. Not too much open source, although I was quite extreme about <em>using</em> open source as much as possible. Dumping windows to install some funky (or maybe even not that funky) linux distribution was a good way in 2006 to create some friction with people and software.</p>
<p>I only took me 2 years to develop enough anxiety to break down, and again that is totally on me, mango was a small (6 when I joined, twice that when I left) company, people were nice and friendly, we went to the pub frequently and played Badminton, they were super helpful for the whole expat with a baby process.</p>
<p>What triggered the break down was that I had to organize an <em>Advanced R Training Course</em>. I did not know what it meant, I still don‚Äôt really know, but in my head it meant something I‚Äôm not good enough to deliver, it meant people are going to ask me questions I won‚Äôt have answers for, it meant I was going to make a fool of myself. And learning more stuff for such an occasion might not be a good plan, because essentially the more you learn, the more you realize how much more you need to learn, and this is daunting in the process of teaching advanced professionnal expert level <em>(add yours)</em> training. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, learning more stuff is generally a good idea, but not really when you do it as part of preparing one of the millions things you think you have to master tomorrow.</p>
<p>I really enjoy when I‚Äôm a room with people transmitting things that I know about R, but at the same time preparing the materials is something I <em>always</em> struggle with, always, no matter the topic, no matter how much I know about it. Knowing something and be able to teach it are two very different games.</p>
<p>I took some time off, but I did not really recover, and we kind of wanted our daughter to go to a french school. So we came back to France, and I was like <em>Ok, so I‚Äôll just do the same exact thing, consulting and training</em> but as an independent freelancer, how hard could it be, right ? Mango was super helpful in the transition process, they even gave me an extra gig. My former employer was my first client, that was nice.</p>
<p>I also had a few contacts, this materialised to few consulting contracts. And anyway, the worst come the worst I can always go hunt for a job. I was very naive to believe that I could pull it off. On top of not being a consultant (more on that below), dealing with paperwork, invoices, spending time on the phone, estimate the time something will take me, multiply that by two, but still be way off, come up with how much I think my time is worth, ‚Ä¶ I was not ready for any of that.</p>
<p>By some miracle, this lasted 8 years, and let‚Äôs just say it has not been the best financial journey, I was structureless, not really giving careful thought about the job. Not thinking is kind of a pattern of me, I just realized it now because of <em>thinking</em> about it, that‚Äôs refreshing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve had some nice projects as a freelancer, organized a few training sessions, travelled to many places again, but for the most part, when you do consulting, not only you work on projects you don‚Äôt choose, but on top of that you work on something someone else did not want to do. Sometimes you‚Äôre lucky and that‚Äôs a nice project, sometimes you might learn something from it, but most of the time you‚Äôd rather be doing something else.</p>
</div>
<div id="open-source-asylum" class="section level2">
<h2>Open source Asylum</h2>
<p>For me, that was seeking asylum in open source projects, I already developped a taste for connecting R with other languages, that started with Java. My first trip to the land of the R internals was because of <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rJava">rJava</a>. I liked the üì¶ but the jni inspired low level interface was a bit hard to grasp, so I helped with the reflection based api with the <code>J</code> function and the use of the <code>$</code> method to access fields and methods.</p>
<p>I discovered Google‚Äôs <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">protocol buffers</a> and I liked it, that usually means I‚Äôm likely to do a package about it, and I could reuse things that I learned from working on <code>rJava</code>. <code>protobuf</code> has a C++ library, so it was very natural to use it to bring them to R. There was a thing called <code>Rcpp</code> that existed at the time, so I started using it to build <code>RProtoBuf</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp">Rcpp</a> was not what it is today, data was copied on the way in from R objects to C++ structures, like <code>std::vector&lt;double&gt;</code> and on the way back from the C++ structures to R objects, the interface was weird, all the classes started with the <code>Rcpp</code> prefix, ‚Ä¶ anyway there was a lot to be unhappy about.</p>
<p>Again, thanks to previous work on <code>RJava</code>, I knew about <a href="https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/0ba66a2bc236ae5b009af910688575aa4adddd2c/src/include/Rinternals.h#L1272"><code>R_PreserveObject</code> and <code>R_ReleaseObject</code></a>, and starting to use them is one of the two best things that ever happened to <code>Rcpp</code> (the other one being attributes from <a href="https://twitter.com/fly_upside_down">JJ</a> ).</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code>/* preserve objects across GCs */
void R_PreserveObject(SEXP);
void R_ReleaseObject(SEXP);</code></pre>
<p>That changed everything, we could now have nice syntax, without paying for expensive data copies. When an <code>Rcpp</code> object (e.g.¬†a <code>NumericVector</code>) is constructed, its underlying R object goes through <code>R_PreserveObject</code> to protect it from the garbage collector, and when the object is destructed, a call is made to <code>R_ReleaseObject</code> to remove that protection.</p>
<p>I ended up working almost full time on Rcpp for several months, and then users started to show up so we had to support them through mailing list and stack overflow and things like that. That‚Äôs a lot of work. I liked it, I did not really pay attention to the fact that I was essentially doing all this work for free. For sure down the line, I organised a few training sessions about <code>Rcpp</code> and I had some contracts around it, but I think it is fair to say that I never really got return on my time investment on the project. We did not really know that this was going to power many cran packages at the time.</p>
<p>Developping <code>Rcpp</code> was for me a way to learn about R internals and C++ at the same time, while doing something that would be generally useful to others. I usually try to install some community side effects when I learn something.</p>
<p>And then this happened.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4106174/where-can-i-learn-how-to-write-c-code-to-speed-up-slow-r-functions"><img src="/img/job/stack-overflow-hadley-R-C.png" /></a></p>
<p>I believe answering that question from <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham">Hadley</a> on stack overflow had a huge impact on a personnal level for sure, but also most importantly on the community. 2010 was a pre-dplyr pre-magrittr-pipe R world, and <code>plyr</code> was running the show. I never really got on the <code>plyr</code> üöÖ, catching Hadley‚Äôs attention about <code>Rcpp</code> is one of the things that led to <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr"><code>dplyr</code></a>.</p>
<p>Working on <code>dplyr</code> is definitely the best thing that ever happened to me. There were clear goals, but a lot of freedom for the implementation, since speed was high on the list, I naturally ended up using a lot (too much perhaps) of <code>Rcpp</code>. And üçí on the üç∞, I could invoice my time.</p>
</div>
<div id="im-not-a-consultant" class="section level2">
<h2>I‚Äôm not a consultant</h2>
<p>I still had private consulting projects, but then a weird pattern started to emerge. In short, I lost interest in the private consulting projects, so these projects would greatly slow me down and build anxiety. I still had to deliver them, and somehow that led to a time black üï≥Ô∏è, all my time was going in there for almost no results, or a very slow üêå progress.</p>
<p>Then the feeling of guilt, why would I be allowed to work on cool (paid nor not paid) projects while I was feeling guilty of not being able to make progress on the others. I then ended up spending less and less time on the things that I liked because the things I didn‚Äôt were resultlessly eating all of it.</p>
<p>Eventually the cool projects were too far, and I could not find the energy to get back at them, and the shame of having disappeared did not help me reaching out, all I would have had to offer was excuses, sorry I‚Äôve been busy and all that. shame.</p>
<p>Being late at delivering also means no money, no stability etc ‚Ä¶ and feeding my imposter syndrome üëø.</p>
<p>The job offer from ThinkR felt like a blessing, I would have a salary, people to interract with, challenging work, and a 80/20 setup so that I could spend 20% of my time on whatever. I has been a nice adventure, the job is interresting and the company is ubiquitous in the üá´üá∑ R community, something I‚Äôve never been able to do on my own.</p>
<p>The old demons were still present though, I can only blame myself for that, but that gluttoned my 20%. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôve not been present and encouraged to be during my year, e.g.¬†event though I did not get to go to <a href="https://user2017.brussels">useR!</a> last year for üë∂ reasons, I have been active on twitter, which triggered curiosity about emojis, planting the seed of future work on the <code>emo</code> üì¶.</p>
<p>Community-me was trying to get out, that twitter activity led to the <a href="https://github.com/ThinkR-open/tweetstorm">tweetstorm</a> shiny app (I only realized later that the word meant something else), which we then used in shiny training courses. Same story with the <a href="https://github.com/ThinkR-open/prenoms">prenoms</a> package, the shiny app about the french <a href="https://github.com/ThinkR-open/legislatives2017">legislatives</a> elections, the <a href="https://github.com/ThinkR-open/collage">collage</a> package, which were then a part of how I would build training material.</p>
<p>This was more evenings and weekends than 20% though, because I did not manage to do what I wanted, and was supposed, to do with my 80%, and depending on the projects on my plate, I would end up being late and exhausted at the end of 80% anyway.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-what-now" class="section level2">
<h2>So what now</h2>
<p>Again, that‚Äôs all on me, but having spent some time to think about it (yeah I do that now), I‚Äôm forced to realize that being a private consultant is not what I am, and not what I want to be, and for the most part if I believe the conversations I typically have at conferences, not really what is expected of me.</p>
<p>My initial one-year contract ended a month ago, and I chose to not renew it, so that I can take over control of my time. But this time, I‚Äôm putting a lot of thoughts into what I want to do with it.</p>
<p>Some people do open source on the side, some people are lucky enough to work for companies that have a very strong commitment to open source. Apart from that, two patterns that I see a lot are - build an open resume, build enough of a github streak to weight in at some future job application. - rewards. I did good on my day job, I‚Äôll reward myself with some open source work, I‚Äôll have a nice feeling about giving back.</p>
<p>Although I think at some points I‚Äôve matched these patterns, I now believe that open source work is neither a stepping stone nor a treat, but real day job kind of work.</p>
<p>My goal now is to spend 100% of my time doing open source work. I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot, so here‚Äôs how I am organizing my weeks now:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>on monday, I‚Äôll work on <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr">dplyr</a>. There‚Äôs still plenty of work to do here, for now I‚Äôve been dealing with issues and bugs, but eventually there is still room for innovation.</p></li>
<li><p>on tuesday, I‚Äôll work on <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow">Apache Arrow</a>, to add R as one of the supported languages, following the steps of the python front end.</p></li>
<li><p>on friday, I‚Äôll work on <a href="https://github.com/rstats-go">ergo</a>, to bridge R and<br />
<a href="https://golang.org">go</a>. For now that means writing a proposal to get funding.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This has worked well so far. It involves some context switching, but forcing myself to block these days gives me enough focus.</p>
<p>That leaves wednesday and thursday that are not associated with strong commitments, I‚Äôll use these days to get involved in miscellaneous projects, not necessarily my own.</p>
</div>
<div id="help" class="section level2">
<h2>Help</h2>
<p>I have setup a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/romainfrancois">patreon</a> page to give the community a way to help me stay free, and continue to get involved in open source projects with some serenity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/romainfrancois"><img src="/img/job/confettis.png" /></a></p>
<p>I totally understand that this is not for everyone, and that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt live in the illusion that I can make an income out of this, but at least this offers a concrete possibility for people or companies to chip in. I believe I‚Äôm much more useful to the community when I‚Äôm free.</p>
<p>I know we have now more formal ways to get funding, but these typically are <em>project</em> oriented, you write a project proposal, you submit it and perhaps you get some funding. This is what I will do for <code>ergo</code>, but this does not apply to miscellaneous small projects and various efforts to support the community.</p>
<p>Platforms such as patreon are <em>people</em> oriented, and are better match for supporting someone who works creatively, you support someone‚Äôs process instead of the end result.</p>
<p>Every donation is welcome and useful, I arbitrarily setup donation suggestions as powers of 2 (<code>2^(0:10)</code>) with emoji titles and some indication of what you‚Äôd help me cover. The first few goals I‚Äôve setup are all about covering expenses related to how I work, things like internet connection and renting a space in a coworking office.</p>
<p>I want to believe in that setup, 3 days a week with strong commitments to 3 important projects, and the remaining two days with more freedom to be involved in miscellaneous projects and communities.</p>
