Typical sunday night, lost in several inception layers of I don't know 
how I got here, what I am doing here and what I was looking for in the first place. 

`r blogdown::shortcode_html("tweet", "967904124506386433")`

So, some extensions allow arbitrary utf-8 characters in the domain name, but 
more importantly you can have arbitrary characters in sub domains. Next thing you 
know, obviously I'm not going to stop at accents or cedilla, I'm on a 
mission to spread emojis everywhere. 

Emojis are characters, just sequence of utf-8 encoded bytes. I've been 
playing with the [`emo`](https://github.com/hadley/emo) package to make it 
easy to include and extract emojis, and the 
[`utf8splain`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/utf8splain) to extract some information 
about unicode runes (aka code points). 

```{r}
(s <- emo::ji_glue( "emojis :party: "))
unclass(s)
utf8splain::runes(s)
```

Typically domain names are only made of boring ascii, but 
[punycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode) gives a way to encode a string
that may contain any unicode characters into a string that only has ascii. 

There are [online tools](https://www.punycoder.com) to perform the encoding
and decoding, and firing the github search engine, I could quickly find 
the simple enough [punycode C library](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/punycode). 

I knew this was going to change my day, I only wish we were able to open 
the door of my [coworking space](http://coworkinmontpellier.org) space
without the help of a locksmith, but I guess that's a story for another day, 
and I had not agreed to install the updates on my mac. Anyway, once the elements
would finally give me a break, I was able to wrap the library in the 
[puny](https://github.com/romainfrancois/puny) package and its `code` 
and `decode` functions. 

```{r}
puny::code( "crème brûlée" )
puny::code( emo::ji_glue("emojis :party: everywhere") )
```

If you add `domain=TRUE`, the function adds the `xn--` prefix and makes 
something suitable for a domain name. 

```{r}
puny::code( emo::ji("package"), domain = TRUE )
```

So that for example [`r emo::ji("package")`.purrple.cat](`r emo::ji("package")`.purrple.cat)
is (for now) a skeleton hugo site generated by [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
and deployed on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com). Eventually, I guess 
it will contain [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) sites for my 
packages, but [I could not get pkgdown to work today](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/520), 
although I have not tried after the issue was fixed ... <span class="note">a nice side effect is that 
I could discover that `pkgdown` uses my [highlight](https://github.com/romainfrancois/highlight)
package and I was able to offer [a pull request](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/pull/523)
because `pkgdown` was using the interface of `highlight` before I 
broke it (for the greater good) last summer. </span>

Aaaaaaanyway, to do this, I've had to use the encoded name 
(`r puny::code( emo::ji("package"), domain = TRUE )`) in both netlify:

... and the DNS settings on my registrar: 

```
xn--cu8h 1800 IN CNAME dreamy-hypatia-b7499e.netlify.com.
```

Unfortunately, all browsers don't treat punycode the same way. On safari, 
everything looks fine, I can browse to 
[`r emo::ji("package")`.purrple.cat](`r emo::ji("package")`.purrple.cat)
and that's how it looks like.

But chrome (at least the version I have) only `r emo::ji("sad")` echoes 
the encoded subdomain.
