This is a blog post version of a presentation I gave during the first 
meetup of the Montpellier chapter of R Ladies. The meetup was quite a success
and planted the seed for a great local R community. 

`r blogdown::shortcode_html("tweet", "1072985559608508417" )`

[Criscely](https://twitter.com/CriscelyLP) started the meetup by a very 
complete presentation of the values and importance of the global R Ladies 
organization, and the desire to create this local community in Montpellier, 
[Cécile](https://twitter.com/cecilesauder) then walked us through 
many packages and functions of the tidyverse with a movie dataset, i.e. 
comparing movies from Disney, Marvel and DC comics. Turns out, 
*The Lion King* was a great success and *Superman Returns* did not do well ...

I was invited to close the meetup with a talk about ...

`rap` is a small experimental package for iterating on rows of
a data frame. The name stands for **r**owwise m**ap** to hint 
at a legacy of both `dplyr::rowwise()` and `purrr::map`. It went 
through a few different names before settling with `rap`: 

 - `zip`, to echo the `zip` operator in python, but then it was 
   too close to zip files and `utils::zip()`. 
 - `zap` was close enough to `zip` but ended like `map`, but then 
   `rlang::zap()` ruled it out

So I let twitter decide between a few options that ended with `ap`. 
And twitter agreed with my favourite option, so here's `rap`. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-2.png" class="slide"/> 

`rap` gives a way to iterate on rows of a data frame, i.e. to 
perform row-wise work. This is not the first attempt at the 
problem. 

The current state of the art was showcased in [Jenny](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan)'s
webinar, [Thinking inside the box: you can do that inside a data frame?!](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/thinking-inside-the-box-you-can-do-that-inside-a-data-frame/), 
which I'm sampling here. I would advise however to check it out, and its 
associated [github repo](https://github.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows)

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-3.png" class="slide" style="width:100%"/> 
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-4.png" class="slide" style="width:100%"/> 
</div>
</div>

We have great tools now, in the tidyverse or elsewhere to work with columns, but working 
with rows is not that easy, and the reason why there are so many different ways to 
approach it, is essentially because we have not figured out "the way". 

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-5.png" class="slide" style="width:100%"/> 
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-6.png" class="slide" style="width:100%"/> 
</div>
</div>

But working with rows becomes a very valuable tool when you realize that 
a column might be more interesting than just a vector of numbers or strings. We now
have tools to routinely produce so-called list columns. 

A list column is just a list, but it sits in a column of a data frame, which 
makes it easy to pair with other columns and to think jointly about a set of 
things. 

So one of the take home messages from Jenny's talk was to embrace the list 
column philosophy and the `map` family of functions from `purrr`. 
We'll come back to that.

The other thing I'm sampling here is the `gapminder` data, available in the 
... `gapminder` package. If you have not yet seen 
[Hans Rosling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w) video, do it now, it 
is an amazing presentation of socio-demographic data for all countries through time, 
highlighting with data and graphics the development of countries. Serioulsy, watch it now. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-8.png" class="slide"/> 

In the `gapminder` package, the data looks like this, it's a simple enough tibble 
with 6 columns. We have continent and country as factors, the year, life expectancy, 
population and gdp per capita. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-9.png" class="slide"/> 

In the original shape, it would not really illustrate the point, 
so we restructure the data to have one row per asian country. 

The resulting `gap_nested` data frame now has only two columns: `country` and 
`data`, which is a list of data frames of all other variables, in other words
the other columns are nested. The `yr1952` variable is created with a 
`mutate()` for modeling purposes. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-10.png" class="slide"/> 

In this shape, we can do some row wised thinking. For each country, we
want a linear model of life expectancy by the number of years since 1952
(the yr1952 column). 

Then we want to extract intercept and slope coefficients for each of these models. 

So we have one model per country, one intercept per country, one slope per country, 
in other words `model`, `intercept` and `slope` have the same length and order as the number
of rows of our `gap_nested` tibble. A tibble is the perfect host for such information, we 
would want to make a list column for the models and numeric columns for the coefficients. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-11.png" class="slide"/> 

This is something that is typically done with the combination of `dplyr::mutate()` and
one sibling of the big `purrr::map()`. To use them we first have to identify a recipee
for one country, and then we let `map()` do the iteration work. 

The `map()` family uses explicit mapping, you have to explcitely say which 
columns you iterate one. 

 - The `map()` calls iterate on the `data` list column, and applies the recipee
   `lm(lifeExp ~ yr1952, data = .x)` to each tibble from the list column. In the recipee, 
   `.x` stands for the current column. 
 - The subsequent `map_dbl()` calls iterate on the `fit` column we just created, so this time
   `.x` stands for one of the models. 
   
The suffix guides the type that is created. Without a suffix, we get a list column. With the 
`_dbl` suffix we get a double (aka numeric) column. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-12.png" class="slide"/> 

We get the results we want and expected. When Jenny gave her talk in the tidyverse 
team meeting and later as an rstudio webinar, I could not quite understand why, but 
I was not fully satisfied with this syntax. 

I think I understand it better now, and I guess it is because I'm lazy and this
is too much work to: 
 
 - have to call a version of `map()` for each column
 - explicitely express what you iterate on
 - remember it and internalize what `.x`, `.y` etc ... stand for in each line

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-13.png" class="slide" style="width:100%"/> 
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-14.png" class="slide" style="width:100%"/> 
</div>
</div>

Furthermore, the syntax evolves depending on the number of things you iterate on. 

If you iterate on one thing with `map()`, `map_dbl()`, `map_chr()`, ... 
you refer to the current value of the thing with `.x`. 

If you iterate on two things with `map2()`, `map2_int()`, `map2_lgl()` etc ... 
you refer to the current value of the first thing with `.x` and the 
current value of the second thing with `.y`. 

But then, there's no `map3()`, `map4()` etc ... when you iterate on more than 
two things, you have to switch to `pmap()`, put your things in a list and make a function 
that carefully aligns its argument to the order of the things in the list, and then 
eventually do something with the things. 

What (in my perhaps very biased opinion) the `map()` family fails to capture 
is that columns of a data frame are related. `map()` actually has no notion 
that the things come from a data frame, it just operates on vectors. 

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-15.png" class="slide" style="width:100%"/> 
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-16.png" class="slide" style="width:100%"/> 
</div>
</div>

The perspective is different in `rap`, and the mapping is implicit about the
columns. What you iterate on is **the rows of the tibble**. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-17.png" class="slide"/> 

With the concept of implicit mapping, the previous example becomes this. We start from
the `gap_nested` data frame and we iterate on its rows implicitely. 

As with the `mutate()` + `map()` example, we can identify 3 components : `who = what ~ how`
 
  - `who`: the name of the column we wish to create
  - `what`: the type of column we create, on the left hand sied of the formula, 
    when it's empty it means you want a list column. 
  - `how`: the recipe. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-18.png" class="slide"/> 

It's just one call to `rap()` to express the idea of iterating on rows of the 
data frame simultaneously. 

Instead of using a function suffix, the type is expressed, in the `vctrs` sense 
in the left hand side of a formula. 

Finally, the recipe directly uses the names of the columns, each name stands for 
the current observation of the column. In the first line `data` is one of the 
tibbles from the `data` column. In the following lines, `fit` stands for one of the 
linear models. 

That's it really. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-19.png" class="slide"/> 

Before jumping to other examples, we need to briefly talk about splicing and 
the splice operator `!!!`. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-20.png" class="slide"/> 

To do that, we need to step back and work with a single model, for e.g. 
the first country. `fit1` is this linear model, we can get its coefficients
by calling the `coef()` function on it, we get a named numeric vector. 

If we want to convert to a tibble, we could laboriously extract each and 
create a tibble. But instead of that we can directly do `tibble(!!!coef(fit1))`
to splice `coef(fit1)`. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-21.png" class="slide"/> 

With that new `!!!` super power, we cna revise the previous example and instead
of making separate columns for intercept and slope we can create
a "data frame column" to host both. Data frame columns are a relatively 
new concept, in that we currently lack proper tools to deal with them. They have been 
there all along, but we don't really have convenient ways to deal with them. 

To do that with `rap()` you need to specify that you are making a data frame
column on the lhs, and then give the recipe to make of one those. `rap()` applies
the recipe to each row, checks that the data frame you created has exactly one 
observation, and finally binds all the data frames together into a single 
data frame column. `r emo::ji("tada")`

Splicing is not a feature of R, so you can't splice anywhere, functions 
have to be programmed in a certain way so that they undestand splicing. This is
the case for `tibble()` and many other functions from the tidyverse. 

`r blogdown::shortcode_html("youtube", "gJLIiF15wjQ")`

To come back to the title of this blog post, we knew since 1995 that spice rap ... but 
also `rap()` sp*l*ice. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-22.png" class="slide"/> 

Last example, illustrating that `rap()` can splice, even `rnorm()` and `runif()` are 
base functions, when we call them in a `rap()` line, splicing magically happens. 

Here we have a tibble that expresses a simulation plan. 

 - The first column `fun` is the function that effectively simulates
 - `n` is the number of observations
 - `params` is a list of function specific parameters to control the simulation. 

So we'd like to call : 

  - `rnorm(5, mean = 10, sd = 2)` on the first row
  - `runif(3, min = 0, max = 2)` on the second
  
and store the results of both in a list column. This is what the `fun(n, !!!params)` says, 
in particular: 
 
  - `fun` is one element of the `fun` column
  - `n` is one number from the `n` column
  - `params` is one of the lists from the list column `params`. 

Finally, there is also the `wap()` function to retrieve the result instead of 
adding it as a column of the data frame. `wap()` is similar to `pmap()` but with 
implicit mapping. I've chosen the name `wap` because it's like `map` but with the `m` 
upside down. 

<img src="/img/rap-rladies/slide-23.png" class="slide"/> 

Once again, `rap` is an experiment, aka a weekend `r emo::ji("package")`. I believe the 
notion of implicit mapping makes a lot of sense, that specifying the desired type 
on the lhs of the formula is not too big of a jump. 

It was cool to present it for the first time in an RLadies meetup, [Faustine](https://twitter.com/Faustine_Bsqt)
even took one of the hex stickers I brought with me.

I also sent some to people who supported me on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/romainfrancois) for whom I 
have the address. I'll bring some to [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), feel free to ask for some.

This is my hand on the logo, and one of my favourite [scratch record](https://www.discogs.com/Crazy-B-Faster-Jay-Genius-Touch-2/release/764071). Thanks again to 
[Thomas](https://twitter.com/thomasp85) for making it an hex logo. I think it's pretty cool 
and would love to see it on your laptops.
